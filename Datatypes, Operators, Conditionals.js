/*
ASSIGNMENT RULES
- All the answers must be written in JavaScript
- You can ask for help, reach the Teaching Assistants if needed
- You can Google / use StackOverflow BUT only when you think you need something we didn't cover during lessons yet
- You can test your code in a separate file or de-commenting the single exercises in this one.
- You can use the bash terminal, the VSCode terminal or the one embedded in your Operating System if you're using macOS or Linux.
- The solution must be available for the tutors by the end of the day (5PM CET)
*/

/* EXERCISE 1
 Enumerate and describe the main datatypes in JavaScript. Try to explain the concepts as you were speaking to a 12 years old.
*/

// Strings - These are statements in your code which can be made up of letters, numbers and symbols, encompassed by "---" or '---'
// Numbers - These are used to purely hold a number value
// Booleans - These can only hold 2 values, True or False, almost like an on/off switch
// Objects - These can be attributed properties to define their characteristics
// Null - This refers to a variable that has no value

/* EXERCISE 2
 Try to describe what a variable is, in your own words.
*/

// A variable is a method used to store data values that can be changed and manipulated later on.

/* EXERCISE 3
 Write the code to execute an addition (a sum) of the numbers 12 and 20.
*/

// ------ let sum1 = 12 + 20;
// ------ console.log(sum1);

/* EXERCISE 4
 Create a variable named x and assign to it the number 12.
*/

let x = 12;

/* EXERCISE 5
 Create a variable called name and assign to it the string "John Doe".
*/

// ------ let name = "John Doe";
// ------ console.log(name);

/* EXERCISE 6
 Execute a subtraction between the number 12 and the variable x you declared before (which is storing the value 12).
*/

// ------ let newSum = x - 12;
// ------ console.log(newSum);

/* EXERCISE 7
 Create two variables: name1 and name2. Assign to name1 the string "john", and to name2 the string "John" (this one has a capital J!)
 Verify that name1 is different from name2 (HINT: check their equality to be false).
 Finally, verify that the equality between name1 and name2 becomes true if both are lowercase (without changing the value of name2).
*/

// ------ let name1 = "john";
// ------ let name2 = "John";

// ------ let name3 = name1 === name2 && true;
// ------ console.log("The names are not the same, it is", name3);

// ------ let name4 = name1 === "john" || name2 === "John";

// ------ console.log("The names match, it is", name4);

/* EXERCISE 8
 Create a variable named x, and assign to it a numeric value less than 10.
 Write the code to print the literal value of x (ex.: if x is 1, it should print "one", if x is 5 it should print "five" etc.).
*/

/* EXERCISE 9
 [Extra] Assign a value to a variable using a ternary operator (this topic has not been covered during lesson yet,
 try to search it by yourself, tomorrow morning we'll discuss it together!)
*/

// function getPrice(Item) {
//   return Item ? "15" : "30";
// }
// console.log(getPrice(true));
// console.log(getPrice(false));
// console.log(getPrice(null));
